Sta 101 TA Meeting Agendas
===========================

#### Dr. Cetinkaya-Rundel & Dr. Windle
#### Spring 2015

### Week 1: Jan 12, 2015

* Discuss any questions on the TA Responsibilities document
* Finalize office hours
* Make sure everyone has access to Lab and PS Dropbox folders
* Reschedule Week 2 meeting (Jan 19 is a holiday) - Jan 19 at noon
* Go over Lab 1

### Week 2: Jan 19, 2015

* Based on feedback on student experience in Lab 1, start Lab 2 reminding students of the following:
    + R code always follows the format `function(what to apply the function to)`, the function is always a verb, and in the parentheses we have what that function should be applied to, as well as sometimes additional parameters (options) for the function.
    + To refer to a variable always use `data$variable`, don't forget about the `$`
    + Go through the markdown file once with the students, and show them what happens in and outside the code chunk. This can be demonstrated by writing a simple function like `5+4` in and outside the code chunk. When you compile they'll see that the statement is calculated if included in the chunk, and rendered as plain text if not. Also remind them how to add chunks when they need them. And the motto **knit early, and often!**, if they do a bunch of work and then knit and there's an issue it'll be hard to find the source of the error. Knitting after every exercise is good practice.
* Feedback from PS1 - include in lecture slides: 
    + Confusion over random sampling as a requirement for causality -- Remind students random sampling -> generalizability, random assignment -> causality.
    + Confusion over cluster sampling as opposed to convenience sampling -- remind students we covered 3 (good) methods of sampling and there are other methods to (convenience, volunteer, etc.), they just happen to be not so good methods
* Mine to send TAs standard text to be used for requesting PDF submission from students who submitted Word document. Going forward Word submission (or other not allowed format) -> 0 on PS.

### Week 3: Jan 26, 2015
* Responding to questions on Piazza
    + If it says "anon to students" do not use the student's name in your response, as it means the student wanted to keep their name anonymous to other students in the class
    + Always first invite the students to start the discussion / provide their thoughts if they haven't done so in their original question
* Regrade requests
    + All regrade requests must go through the professor
    + If a student emails you, forward the email to the prof, and cc the student letting them know this is what you're doing
* Peer evaluations
    + Walk head TAs through how to set up the Qualtrics surveys
    + Ask for feedback on wording of peer evaluation questions
* For future review:
    + Review question on estimating measures of position based on relative frequency histogram

* Review questions on Coursera will be revealed after RA3 
    + If you catch issues/typos let me know
* Peer evaluation 1: Due Friday 2/2
    + Mine to write R code to parse through the data and create output to post + share with instructor
