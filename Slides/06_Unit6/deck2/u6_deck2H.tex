\subsection{Inference for regression uses the T distribution}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Inference for regression uses the T distribution}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use a T distribution for inference on the slope, with degrees of freedom $n - 2$
\begin{itemize}
\item Degrees of freedom for the slope(s) in regression is $df = n - p - 1$ where $p $ is the number of predictors (explanatory variables) in the model.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Hypothesis testing for a slope: $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$; $H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$ \\
\begin{itemize}
\item $T_{n-2} = \frac{b_1 - 0}{SE_{b_1}}$
\item p-value = P(observing a slope at least as different from 0 as the one observed if in fact there is no relationship between $x$ and $y$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Confidence intervals for a slope: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $b_1 \pm T^\star_{n-2} SE_{b_1}$
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Conditions for regression}
\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conditions for regression}

\begin{itemize}

\item Linearity $\rightarrow$ randomly scattered residuals around 0 in the residuals plot -- important regardless of doing inference

\pause

\item Nearly normally distributed residuals $\rightarrow$ histogram or normal probability plot of residuals -- important for inference

\pause

\item Constant variability of residuals (\hl{homoscedasticity}) $\rightarrow$ no fan shape in the residuals plot -- important for inference

\pause

\item Independence of residuals (and hence observations) $\rightarrow$ depends on data collection method, often violated for time-series data --  important for inference

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item  \hl{Outlier} is an unusual point without these special characteristics (this one likely affects the intercept only)
